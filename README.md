## Description

#### 3/19 Work from Home Summary
- Best Restaurants
  - Implement styling with custom CSS and HTML partials
  - Develop Edit() and Delete() functionality for Reviews
  - Attach reviews to specific restaurants ONLY - no index.
  - MySQL database construction and manipulation
  - Entity Framework Viewbag and Helper functions - further exploration
- Struggles:
  - Requiring pure HTML instead of Helper functions to correctly bind values
  - Implementing timestamps as auto-generated values
  - Transferring data between controllers, which broke when we tried to link through a ```<button>``` rather than ```<p>``` tag.


#### 3/18 Work from Home Summary
- To Do List Edit and Delete with Entity
- Best Restaurants
- Struggles: 
  - Printing list of items on the category's detail page (the lists were initialized to empty, and never filled)
  - Routing with id numbers for views for reviews/object types passed between different controllers and views
  - adding review to restaurant and returning to restaurant details page
  - Networking error? Things not adding to database, then appeared all at once
