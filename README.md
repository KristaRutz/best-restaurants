## Description

Track your favorite restaurants of any cuisine you like to eat!

This application allows a user to keep track of inputted cuisines, restaurants, and reviews. Each of these 3 types of inputs are stored in a database, and can be edited or deleted. Reviews are associated with a specific restaurant, and restaurants are tied to one cuisine, but there is no limit to the amount of cuisines, reviews, or restaurants that a user can make.

This application makes use of a fully functioning front end website with forms and menus for the user to interact with.

#### 3/19 Work from Home Summary
- Best Restaurants
  - Implement styling with custom CSS and HTML partials
  - Develop Edit() and Delete() functionality for Reviews
  - Attach reviews to specific restaurants ONLY - no index.
  - MySQL database construction and manipulation
  - Entity Framework Viewbag and Helper functions - further exploration
  - Finished README for all sections
- Help other classmates with coding issues
- Technical Interview Practice Questions
  - In depth review of terminology and concepts
- Whiteboarding
- Struggles:
  - Requiring pure HTML instead of Helper functions to correctly bind values
  - Implementing timestamps as auto-generated values
  - Transferring data between controllers, which broke when we tried to link through a ```<button>``` rather than ```<p>``` tag.


#### 3/18 Work from Home Summary
- To Do List Edit and Delete with Entity
- Best Restaurants
- Struggles: 
  - Printing list of items on the category's detail page (the lists were initialized to empty, and never filled)
  - Routing with id numbers for views for reviews/object types passed between different controllers and views
  - adding review to restaurant and returning to restaurant details page
  - Networking error? Things not adding to database, then appeared all at once

## Notable Features
This project shows a nicely styled application using a database with objects within objects within objects (Reviews within Restaurants within Cuisines).  Routing between pages is intuitive and comprehensive for ease of movement between pages.

## Specifications

- Create a website where users can add their favorite restaurants based on the type of cuisine they offer.

- Add a Cuisine class. Build out all CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for this class. Remember that "Read" means to view a particular cuisine and to list out all of the cuisines.

- Add a Restaurant class. Build out all CRUD functionality for this class.

- Add properties other than name to your Restaurant class so that you can display descriptive information about the restaurants.

- Make the connection between a cuisine and a restaurant in the database. A cuisine can have many restaurants, but a restaurant can only be attached to one cuisine.

- Allow a user to search for all of a cuisine's restaurants.

- Build out a Review class and make the relationship in the database so that a restaurant has many reviews. Pretend that the users who are reviewing the website are different from the user who added the restaurant.

- Display all of the reviews at the bottom of the restaurant's page.
